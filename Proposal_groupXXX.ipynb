    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease affects millions of people each year and is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. The early prediction and diagnosis of heart disease is crucial for early intervention, improved treatment, and better patient outcomes. It is thus critical that medical practitioners have access to tools that would grant them the ability to make such early detections of heart disease in patients, a challenge that our project seeks to address.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our model utilizes various health factors in its prediction of heart disease, it is crucial to understand how these factors influence the probability of an individual having heart disease. Extensive prior research exists which meticulously analyzes how factors such as BMI and age contribute to the likelihood of heart disease, illuminating the complex relationships that our model seeks to capture. A 2021 study by the American Heart Association found that obesity, as quantified by BMI, is directly responsible for a range of cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension which heavily contribute to an increased likelihood of heart disease <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). A WebMD article corroborates that individuals past the age of 65 are drastically more susceptible to heart failure and other conditions that are linked to heart disease <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Due to their high impact nature, it is clearly imperative that BMI and age, along with the other 15 health factors, be integrated into our model should we want to comprehensively predict heart disease in patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Past research has also shown machine learning models to be excellent predictors of medical conditions like heart disease. A 2023 study found various neural network models to be capable of achieving up to 94.78% accuracy in heart disease prediction <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). Due to the past success of these models, it becomes increasingly clear that machine learning algorithms are best fitted towards solving our problem of predicting heart disease. \n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly describe the problem that you are solving. Avoid ambiguous words. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one ML-relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms), measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).\n",
    "\n",
    "As described earlier, heart disease is a huge problem, and according to our dataset, affects a lot of people/patients. Fortunately, heart disease is treatable and there chances of it being treated are far better if prevented early on. Our problem we hope to solve is that given our dataset filled with various factors relating to a patient, can we build a ML model that can accurately predict a person's chance of getting heart disease. Our datatset features a variety of patients' information such as their BMI, gender, race and etc. which we believe can be used to generate patterns in the form of \"there are ... patients who have heart disease\", \"...% of patients who are between the tages of 50-60 have heart disease\" and etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is quantifiable as it expresses the risk of hear disease as a percentage or a singular yes/no to express whether that person should be worries about heart disease if they continue their current lifestyle. This model's performance can be measured by how accurately it tracks a person's actual risk of heart disease. This can be achieved by splitting the datatset in two: one called the training datatset and one called the validation dataset. If the assumption that heart disease can be predicted using certain factors, then changing the datatset by a factor of 2 shouldn't change anything. Finally, this problem is replicable as our dataset and other ML training methods can be shared and used by everyone / other datasets to reproduce results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use ML training methods such as logisitic regression to train a predictive model on our dataset, or one half of the datatset coined as the training dataset, to do testing on the other half of the datatset for validation purposes. We could also run several feature detection tasks to ensure that the most predominant features are used to predict heart disease."

    "Data Collection\n",
    "- **Informed Consent**: The human subjects opted in, as they could have refused the telemarketing survey, hung up the phone at any time, or refused to answer questions. \n",
    "- **Collection Bias/Bias Mitigation**: Some bias is towards people that are willing to give their information, which might be affected by age or location. It also restricts the survey to those that have access to phone services. This dataset might also be affected by access to healthcare: certain diagnoses like diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease might be missed for lower-income people that don't have the resources to get diagnosed. While we cannot fix the collection process, we will need to do exploratory data analysis to see what demographics are represented and if there are any specific groups are over- or underrepresented. \n",
    "- **Limit PII exposure**: Health information is inherently personally identifiable. However, the dataset has been cleaned to only include Sex, Age, and Race as the most PII. We can do research into whether these factors are very important in predicting heart disease, or if there's negligible difference. If there are not significant differences, we can anonymize this dataset further. \n",
    "\n",

    "- **Redress**: To prevent unintentional user harm, we would also put a warning that this model is not a recommendation from medical professionals and is purely based on data. If this were to be in production for a while, we could update our model based on yearly new releases from the CDC's BRFSS. We can also provide a feedback form for any user complaints. \n",

With some analysis of the data, we have identified the different unique values for columns with data containing words, strings, and categories, and identified the distributions of the data contanining numerical values. The data includes no null values and we have upwards of 200k different values and 40 different columns to work with. Next, we will use one-hot encoding of the data to set up the data to do classification and analysis to predict what factors affect heart disease in patients.  "
