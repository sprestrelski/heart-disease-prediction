    "# Abstract \n",
    "In this project, we aim to explore patterns and potential indicators related to heart disease within a dataset derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) annual telephone surveys conducted by the CDC. The dataset comprises responses from individuals, with each row representing a unique respondent and 19 columns representing various health factors that could influence heart disease risk. These factors include BMI, Smoking, Alcohol Drinking, Stroke, and others, with some being binary in nature and others requiring one-hot encoding for proper analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach employs unsupervised machine learning models, specifically K-Means clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), to identify natural groupings or patterns in the data without using the heart disease status as a label. This exploratory phase is crucial for understanding underlying structures within the dataset and potentially uncovering new insights into the relationships between different health factors and heart disease risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the effectiveness of our clustering models, we will employ the Silhouette Score as a metric to gauge the cohesion and separation of the identified clusters. The Silhouette Score, ranging from -1 to 1, offers insight into the fit of the data points within their clusters relative to other clusters, thereby providing a quantitative measure of the clustering quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, given the availability of true labels in our dataset regarding heart disease indicators—such as prior occurrences of heart attacks, angina, and strokes—we will also utilize the Adjusted Rand Score for a more nuanced evaluation. The Adjusted Rand Score, which adjusts for chance, will allow us to measure the similarity between the clusters formed by our unsupervised models and the actual distribution of heart disease cases, thus offering an additional layer of validation for our clustering approach."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease affects millions of people each year and is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. The early prediction and diagnosis of heart disease is crucial for early intervention, improved treatment, and better patient outcomes. It is thus critical that medical practitioners have access to tools that would grant them the ability to make such early detections of heart disease in patients, a challenge that our project seeks to address.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our model utilizes various health factors in its prediction of heart disease, it is crucial to understand how these factors influence the probability of an individual having heart disease. Extensive prior research exists which meticulously analyzes how factors such as BMI and age contribute to the likelihood of heart disease, illuminating the complex relationships that our model seeks to capture. A 2021 study by the American Heart Association found that obesity, as quantified by BMI, is directly responsible for a range of cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension which heavily contribute to an increased likelihood of heart disease <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). A WebMD article corroborates that individuals past the age of 65 are drastically more susceptible to heart failure and other conditions that are linked to heart disease <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Due to their high impact nature, it is clearly imperative that BMI and age, along with the other 15 health factors, be integrated into our model should we want to comprehensively predict heart disease in patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Past research has also shown machine learning models to be excellent predictors of medical conditions like heart disease. A 2023 study found various neural network models to be capable of achieving up to 94.78% accuracy in heart disease prediction <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). Due to the past success of these models, it becomes increasingly clear that machine learning algorithms are best fitted towards solving our problem of predicting heart disease. \n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "As described earlier, heart disease is a huge problem, and according to our dataset, affects a huge population. Fortunately, heart disease is treatable and chances of it being treated are far better if prevented early on. Our problem we hope to solve is that, given our dataset filled with various factors relating to a patient, can we build a ML model that can accurately predict a person's chance of getting heart disease? Our dataset features a variety of patients' information including their BMI, gender, and medical history, which we believe can be used to generate patterns in the form of quantitative metrics such as \"there are X patients who have heart disease\" and \"X% of patients who are between the ages of 50-60 have heart disease.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is quantifiable as it expresses the risk of heart disease as a percentage or a singular yes/no to express whether that person should be worries about heart disease if they continue their current lifestyle. This model's performance can be measured by how accurately it tracks a person's actual risk of heart disease. This can be achieved by splitting the dataset into three: training, validation, and testing, with the training dataset larger than the validation and testing. Finally, this problem is replicable as our dataset and other ML training methods can be shared and used by everyone / other datasets to reproduce results. Our models can also be retrained later with updated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use ML training methods such as logistic regression to train a predictive model on our dataset, or one half of the dataset coined as the training dataset, to do testing on the other half of the dataset for validation purposes. We could also run several feature detection tasks to ensure that the most predominant features are used to predict heart disease."

    "    - Each observation is a U.S. resident that provided their health status as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)'s telephone surveys.\n",

    "According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/risk_factors.htm), \n",
    "> About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although high blood pressure and high cholesterol are hard to measure, diabetes and obesity are indicators of high blood pressure, making `BMI`, `Diabetic`, and `PhysicalActivity` critical variables, as well as `Smoking`. BMI is numerical, Diabetic is Yes/No/Other, PhysicalActivity is Yes/No, and Smoking is Yes/No. PhysicalActivity is not very well described, so we will need to check how this dataset was [created](https://github.com/kamilpytlak/data-science-projects/blob/main/heart-disease-prediction/2022/documentation/vars_list_with_descriptions.txt) and match up the raw data with the processed data to figure out how to interpret some of the variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to convert binary columns that are listed as Yes/No to 0s and 1s, and category columns like `General Health` to some sort of numerical in order to vectorize all of the data. "

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compare the performance of different techniques of unsupervised learning methods learned in class. This includes methods such as K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models, Hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering. Since there are 17 predicting variables for a binary value, we'll likely have to do some sort of dimensionality reduction such as Principal Component Analysis to make the model more manageable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although traits like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are known to be risk factors for heart disease, we are unsure of their predictive value compared to other traits in the dataset, since there is no simple equation for heart disease. Thus, unsupervised learning methods can help us see if there's any trends in the data of people with similar traits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will split our data into a training, validation, and test set to evaluate the performance of our models. Each model will be trained on the training set, then evaluated on the validation set for initial results. Once we've tuned the hyperparameters for each of the individual models, we will do a final evaluation against the test set. We will compare our methods to a baseline [logistic regression model](https://share.streamlit.io/kamilpytlak/heart-condition-checker/main/app.py) developed by the creator of the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will do all work in Jupyter notebooks using publicly available models and datasets, as well as provide links to any resources used so that our work is reproducible. "

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "One evaluation metric to be used is silhouette score which takes into account the distances between the points of one cluster and the nearest cluster center. The function for silhouette score can be generalized as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{separation - cohesion}{max(separation, cohesion)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The silhouette score will be used after we train our K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Model to look into how well each point is matched to its own cluster as opposed to neighboring clusters. The score ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating the point is perfectly matched to the cluster, 0 indicates that a point is between two clusters, and -1 indicates that a data point is in the wrong cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another evaluation metric that will be used is adjusted rand score. which measures how similar two clusters are. It is calculated as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ARS = \\frac{\\text{Index - Expected Index}}{\\text{Max Index - Expected Index}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric requires the data to have true labels which our dataset does have. The metric will be used after training our models and calculating their silhouette scores. It measures the similarity between two data clusterings, one which will be given by our unsupervised model and the other defined by our true label. The score ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect alignment between the learned clusters and the true labels, 0 indicating no relationship, and -1 indicates that the entire cluster is labeled incorrectly.

    "Using the provided data science ethics checklist from https://deon.drivendata.org, we discuss the following potential concerns with ethics and data privacy:\n",
    "Data Collection\n",
    "- **Informed Consent**: The human subjects opted in, as they could have refused the telemarketing survey, hung up the phone at any time, or refused to answer questions. \n",
    "- **Collection Bias/Bias Mitigation**: Some bias is towards people that are willing to give their information, which might be affected by age or location. It also restricts the survey to those that have access to phone services. This dataset might also be affected by access to healthcare: certain diagnoses like diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease might be missed for lower-income people that don't have the resources to get diagnosed. While we cannot fix the collection process, we will need to do exploratory data analysis to see what demographics are represented and if there are any specific groups are over- or underrepresented. \n",
    "- **Limit PII exposure**: Health information is inherently personally identifiable. However, the dataset has been cleaned to only include Sex, Age, and Race as the most PII. We can do research into whether these factors are very important in predicting heart disease, or if there's negligible difference. If there are not significant differences, we can anonymize this dataset further. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Storage\n",
    "- **Data retention plan**: This dataset is public and managed by someone else. However, in the testing phase, we should not store any results of people who test our model if they input their own information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment\n",
    "- **Monitoring and Evaluation**: If this ML project were to go into production, we would not collect user data. Any computations would be done on the client side, meaning we have no access to any of the user inputs and thus cannot store them.\n",
    "- **Redress**: To prevent unintentional user harm, we would also put a warning that this model is not a recommendation from medical professionals and is purely based on data. If this were to be in production for a while, we could update our model based on yearly new releases from the CDC's BRFSS. We can also provide a feedback form for any user complaints. \n",

With some analysis of the data, we have identified the different unique values for columns with data containing words, strings, and categories, and identified the distributions of the data contanining numerical values. The data includes no null values and we have upwards of 200k different values and 40 different columns to work with. Next, we will use one-hot encoding of the data to set up the data to do classification and analysis to predict what factors affect heart disease in patients.  "
