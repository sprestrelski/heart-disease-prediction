    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "Data Collection\n",
    "- **Informed Consent**: The human subjects opted in, as they could have refused the telemarketing survey, hung up the phone at any time, or refused to answer questions. \n",
    "- **Collection Bias/Bias Mitigation**: Some bias is towards people that are willing to give their information, which might be affected by age or location. It also restricts the survey to those that have access to phone services. This dataset might also be affected by access to healthcare: certain diagnoses like diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease might be missed for lower-income people that don't have the resources to get diagnosed. While we cannot fix the collection process, we will need to do exploratory data analysis to see what demographics are represented and if there are any specific groups are over- or underrepresented. \n",
    "- **Limit PII exposure**: Health information is inherently personally identifiable. However, the dataset has been cleaned to only include Sex, Age, and Race as the most PII. We can do research into whether these factors are very important in predicting heart disease, or if there's negligible difference. If there are not significant differences, we can anonymize this dataset further. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Storage\n",

    "Deployment\n",
    "- **Monitoring and Evaluation**: If this ML project were to go into production, we would not collect user data. Any computations would be done on the client side, meaning we have no access to any of the user inputs and thus cannot store them.\n",
    "- **Redress**: To prevent unintentional user harm, we would also put a warning that this model is not a recommendation from medical professionals and is purely based on data. If this were to be in production for a while, we could update our model based on yearly new releases from the CDC's BRFSS. We can also provide a feedback form for any user complaints. \n",
